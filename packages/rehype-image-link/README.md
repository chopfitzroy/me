# Rehype Image Link

Wraps all images that do not already have a link wrapping them with a link back to the original image.

Very similar to the `linkImagesToOriginal` option in [`gatsby-remark-images`](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/plugins/gatsby-remark-images/). This however does not required Gatsby.
