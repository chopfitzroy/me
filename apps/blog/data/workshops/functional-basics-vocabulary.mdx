title: "Functional basics - vocabulary"
---

This workshop focuses on some of the core vocabulary used in functional programming.

This workshop is not trying to convince you that functional programming is useful but presumes you already know this and want to learn more.

You most likely already do a lot of what this workshop will cover without even knowing it! This workshop will give you the correct vocabulary to help articulate these concepts with your peers.

Below you will find a video guide that takes you through the workshop step by step. There are also interactive code snippets below that can be used to practice what is being discussed in the video.

### Partial execution ‚è≥

Partial execution is essentially when one function returns another function which has scope over the first function. If you are familiar with closures in JavaScript this is essentially the same thing.

Partial execution allows as to take context from one point in the applications life cycle and maintain scope over that context for later use. Often this context will be some sort of configuration that will make our lives easier later on.
