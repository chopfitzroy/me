For the longest time I've wanted to build a blog from scratch, something I could say I built from the ground up.

Well after years of failed attempts and moving onto the _next thing_ I am happy to say I have finally built a blog the way I want.

What was the main difference this time? I had a clear vision of what I wanted. I have blogged before on platforms like [Medium](https://medium.com/@crashybang/about), as well as hosting an [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/) starter kit. But none of that had really stuck... I wasn't invested in the outcome, I didn't know what I wanted to write about and I had no schedule or motivators to encourage me to keep going.

So this time I outlined what I wanted to achieve _long_ before I wrote any code. Here is a list of things I knew I wanted.

- Something that I had built from scratch and could extend whenever and however I wanted.
- Something fast with good SEO preferably a static site generator if possible.
- Something that supported `.mdx` files which are my favourite way of authoring content.
- First class TypeScript support in terms of code snippets.
- A workflow that allowed my partner to proof read my posts and provide feedback before publishing.

So with that in mind let's break down how I achieved the above.

### Building something extenable

There were a couple of key critera here, I wanted something that didn't have too much _magic_ and utilized technologies I enjoyed working with. The technologies I wanted to include were primary [React]() and [Tailwind]().

Now one of my other critera was something with good SEO and preferably a static site generator, initially I reached for [Astro]() which I had been reading about a lot and supported [React]() and [Tailwind]() in the way that I wanted.

Unfortunately I also wanted to use [Shiki Twoslash]() which I will discuss more later for TypeScript snippets and no matter how hard [I tried]() I could not figure out a way to make this work with [Astro](). So what now? Well the next obvious choice was [Next.js]() which I knew about but have never used personally.

Like most people I have heard of and even used [Vercel]() so I was familiar enough with what [Next.js]() was but have never been lucky enough to work with it professionally, spoiler alert it's amazing! The first thing I did was setup `.mdx` file support so I could author blog posts using this format. However it pretty quickly became apparent that the [suggested way](https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/using-mdx) of setting this up while adequate created a somewhat awkward publishing flow.

Excited by this new tool and enjoying the process so far I set out to investigate how other developers were solving this problem, and boy oh boy was it my lucky day when I stumbled across [Lee Robinson's own blog](https://leerob.io/) which is also powered by [Next.js]() but uses a wonderful tool known as [contentlayer](https://www.contentlayer.dev/) to manage content authoring. I cannot **overstate** just how much this tool changes the game! It makes authoring content in [Next.js]() applications an absolute pleasure!

Setting this tools up is a tad involved and not really something I want to go into as part of this post, that being said the [source code](https://github.com/chopfitzroy/me) for this entire blog is available on Github so I encourage you to check it out if you are interested in trying these tools out for yourself.



```ts twoslash
interface IdLabel {
  id: number /* some fields */;
}
interface NameLabel {
  name: string /* other fields */;
}
type NameOrId<T extends number | string> = T extends number
  ? IdLabel
  : NameLabel;
// This comment should not be included

// ---cut---
function createLabel<T extends number | string>(idOrName: T): NameOrId<T> {
  throw "unimplemented";
}

let a = createLabel("typescript");
```
