For the longest time I've wanted to build a blog from scratch, something I could say I built from the ground up.

Well after years of failed attempts and moving onto the _next thing_ I am happy to say I have finally built a blog the way I want.

What was the main difference this time? I had a clear vision of what I wanted. I have blogged before on platforms like [Medium](https://medium.com/@crashybang/about), as well as hosting an [11ty starter kit](https://github.com/chopfitzroy/chopfitzroy.dev). But none of that had really stuck... I wasn't invested in the outcome, I didn't know what I wanted to write about and I had no schedule or motivators to encourage me to keep going.

So this time I outlined what I wanted to achieve _long_ before I wrote any code. Here is a list of things I knew I wanted.

- Something that I had built from scratch and could extend whenever and however I wanted.
- Something that supported `.mdx` files which are my favourite way of authoring content.
- Something fast with good SEO preferably a static site generator if possible.
- Something that considers the reading experience a top priority.
- Interactive and informative code snippets that could be easily walked through.
- A workflow that allowed my partner to proof read my posts and provide feedback before publishing.

So with that in mind let's break down how I achieved the above.

### Building something extenable

There were a couple of key critera here, I wanted something that didn't have too much _magic_ and utilized technologies I enjoyed working with. The technologies I wanted to include were primary [React](https://beta.reactjs.org/) and [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/).

Now one of my other critera was something with good SEO and preferably a static site generator, initially I reached for [Astro]() which I had been reading about a lot and supported [React](https://beta.reactjs.org/) and [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) in the way that I wanted.

Initially I really wanted to use [Shiki Twoslash](https://shikijs.github.io/twoslash/) for it's **amazing** TypeScript snippets. Unfortunately I could [not  get this up and running](https://github.com/shikijs/twoslash/issues/148) with [Astro](https://astro.build/). So I ended up running with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) which has ended up bening an absolute please to work with.

The first thing I did was setup `.mdx` file support so I could author blog posts using this format. However it pretty quickly became apparent that the [suggested way](https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/using-mdx) of setting this up while adequate created a somewhat awkward publishing flow.

Excited by this new tool and enjoying the process so far I set out to investigate how other developers were solving this problem, and boy oh boy was it my lucky day when I stumbled across [Lee Robinson's own blog](https://leerob.io/) which is also powered by [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and uses [contentlayer](https://www.contentlayer.dev/) for content management. I cannot **overstate** just how much this tool changes the game! It makes authoring content in [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) applications an absolute pleasure!

**Update:** Since publishing this article [Lee Robinson's blog](https://leerob.io/) has moved over to [Sanity](https://www.sanity.io/) so if you are interested in his original implementation be sure to work through [his repositories](https://github.com/leerob/leerob.io) history.

Setting this tools up is a tad involved and not really something I want to go into as part of this post, that being said the [source code](https://github.com/chopfitzroy/me) for this entire blog is available on Github so I encourage you to check it out if you are interested in trying these tools out for yourself.

### Building with SEO in mind

Usually when I build something for myself I consider SEO an absolute last priority. This isn't because I don't want people to find what I'm building but more that most of what I build is for myself and I'm not really bothered about whether or not other people can find it.

This time I wanted to make sure I could be found, in fact I wanted to put as much effort into being found as possible. This time I've got something to say and I want to make sure people can hear it! ðŸ“£ 

For the most part this meant using things like [`next-sitemap`](https://github.com/iamvishnusankar/next-sitemap) and relying on a lot of the optimizations [Next.js]() already makes under the hood.

As it stands I feel like I have set myself up for success in this area. There is still a ton of improvement that can be made here and I am looking forward to researching how to further fine tune my content.

### Building something that makes reading enjoyable

There is nothing I love more than a blog that is primarily focused around the content it delivers, minimal use of popups, carousels, etc... I spent a lot of time agonizing over font families and color palletes (especially dark mode) this time round.

I'd read a bit about [Tufte CSS](https://edwardtufte.github.io/tufte-css/) and even found [this blog](https://lawler.io/) on [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/news) that employed similar techniques. I knew I wanted something like this that really felt like it _got out of the way_ and just let readers read!

Overall I am really happy with where I got to on this and think I achieved the aesthetic I initally set out to uncover. It is worth noting that a huge part of my success here can be attributed to the [`@tailwindcss/typography`](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/typography-plugin) plugin which made styling markdown pages an absolute breeze.

### Building something with interactive and informative code snippets

This was easily the most important thing to me. In previous blogging I had noticed a pattern in the terms of content I enjoyed authoring. Most of this content was situated around the JavaScript/TypeScript space so I wanted to make sure that these two languages got the most love when it came to interactive code snippets.

I explored a ton of options in this space and the top contenders were [Shiki Twoslash](https://shikijs.github.io/twoslash/), [Sandpack](https://sandpack.codesandbox.io/) and [CodeHike](https://codehike.org/) (which actually leverages [Sandpack](https://sandpack.codesandbox.io/) for it's previews).

Each of these options have serious pros and cons and I encourage you to check them all out if you are thinking of doing something similar. For myself [CodeHike](https://codehike.org/) ended up being the best option, [Shiki Twoslash](https://shikijs.github.io/twoslash/) actually had it beat on enhanced TypeScript support and [Sandpack](https://sandpack.codesandbox.io/) is arguably more customisable but [CodeHike](https://codehike.org/) has the nicest _out of the box_ features and allowed me to get up and running quickly. Additionally [CodeHike](https://codehike.org/) provided the most streamlined way to provide code _walk throughs_ which I consider to be a top priority as far as my blog is concerned.

<CH.Code>

```ts one.ts
type U<T> = T | undefined;

const trap =
  <T extends (...args: any[]) => any>(handler: T) =>
  async (...args: Parameters<T>): Promise<[unknown, U<ReturnType<T>>]> => {
    try {
      const result = await handler(...args);
      return [undefined, result];
    } catch (err) {
      return [err, undefined];
    }
  };

export { trap };
```

```ts two.ts
console.log('Hello World');
```
