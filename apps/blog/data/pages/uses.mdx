This page is heavily inspired by [Wes Bos /uses](https://wesbos.com/uses) and is intended to answer any questions about my setup.

### Software üê¢

I use [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) for code editing and keep a semi up-to-date copy of my config in this [gist](https://gist.github.com/chopfitzroy/338df3e01296738c13ba28d41f896213). I use [Microsoft Terminal](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/windows-terminal/9n0dx20hk701) with [WSL 2](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) when working on Windows machines and [Kitty](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/) whenever I am on iOS or Linux.

I host almost everything on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) and use [GitHub](https://github.com/) for tracking any personal projects. I also make use of [Nuclino](https://www.nuclino.com/) for a wide range of things including to-do lists, document storage, knowledge gardens, etc...

### Hardware üê≠

Over the years I have collected all sorts of bits and bobs but here are the things I use in my day-to-day and get the most value out of. I use a [Ducky One](https://www.duckychannel.com.tw/en) keyboard, a [Razer Naga](https://www.razer.com/gaming-mice/razer-naga-pro) wireless MMO mouse, an [Audio-Technica AT2020](https://www.audio-technica.com/en-us/at2020) microphone and a [Logitech C920](https://www.logitech.com/en-nz/products/webcams/c920-pro-hd-webcam.960-000770.html) webcam.

Supplementary to the above I also use a [ConnectPRO UDP2-12AP-KIT](https://connectpro.com/product/udp2-12ap-kit-2port-dual-displayport-kvm) which allows me to switch the above peripherals between two machines at the click of a button. Finally I use a [Remarkable 2](https://remarkable.com/) for on-the-go note taking and document viewing.
